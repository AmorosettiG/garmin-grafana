## Credits

This project is made possible by the generous contribution to the [gofundme](https://gofund.me/0d53b8d1) advertised in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1jucwhu/update_free_and_open_source_garmin_grafana/) on Reddit's [r/garmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin) community. I wanted to build this tool for a long time, but funds were never sufficient for me to get a Garmin, because they are pretty expensive. With the community donations, I was able to buy a Garmin Vivoactive 6 and built this tool open to everyone. if you are using this tool and enjoy it, please remember what made this possible! Huge shoutout to the [r/garmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin) community for being generous, trusting me and actively supporting my idea!
